# hello-world

Heya Happy People!

Glk is here, I'm new to all this software development thing, Ihave done 
some programming in past. Visual Basic being my first programming language in the college.
Some web development with html, css, and basic javascript.
Since complete the bachelor in Networking & Supports, IT management. Knowledge of bash, cmd, powershell, cisco ios is a must.
I'm very fascinate about software, I don't know why ?
have spent my last year in college playing around web service using C# with azure cloud.

after college i decided to learn and improve my knowledge about thing that intrigue me the most. Starting with Programming.

I went back to C languege, wow!, I don't know why my college did not include this language part of my education also.
Having finished playing around C, i decided to advance to C++ before I get to my destination which is C#.

You may asked why?
Because we are a say in french language I cite "reculer pour mieux sauter".
